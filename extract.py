The idea is to install a \'Legacy WhatsApp\'  ===\n===       temporarily on your device in order to get the android backup      ===\n===     permission. You WILL NOT lose any data and your current WhatsApp     ===\n===   version will be installed after this process so don\'t panic and don\'t  ===\n=== stop this script while it\'s working. However if something fails you can  ===\n===    run \'restore_whatsapp.py\' and reinstall current WhatsApp or simply    ===\n=== update that from Google Play Store. But it\'s always a good idea to take  ===\n===  a backup. For that go to \'WhatsApp settings\\Chat Settings\\Chat Backup\'  ===\n===              here take a local bacakup.
