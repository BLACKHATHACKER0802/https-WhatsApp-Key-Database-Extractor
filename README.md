## About The Project

[![Glimpse][product-screenshot]](https://github.com/yuvrajraghuvanshis/WhatsApp-Key-Database-Extractor)

This project is inspired by [EliteAndroidApps/WhatsApp-Key-DB-Extractor](https://github.com/EliteAndroidApps/WhatsApp-Key-DB-Extractor). Since Android v4.0+ Google has removed adb backup  and apps no longer supported being abcked up by "adb backup -f myApp.ab -apk com.foobar.app". However there is one catch in this scenario and that is some old version of many apps including WhatsApp support that to this day, and that's the idea...

The idea is to install "Legacy Version" of WhatsApp on you device via adb and use "adb backup"  to fetch files from "/data/data/com.whatsapp" folder which includes both the 'key' and 'msgstore.db' (non encrypted) file and after that restore current WhatsApp.

* [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/)

### Troubleshooting

```bash
* daemon not running. starting it now on port 5037 *
* daemon started successfully *
List of devices attached 
0123a4b5678	device
emulator-5554 unauthorized
```
* Choose device from "List of devices attached" : 0123a4b5678
* If you have never used USB Debugging before, you may also need to verify the fingerprint.  
* If you have set a default backup password in your Android settings, then this MUST be the  backup password that you PROVIDE when prompted to backup your data. Else it WILL fail!  
* If you get an error saying "AES encryption not allowed" then you need to update your Oracle Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) to Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files.  
* WhatsApp crashing? Run `python3 restore_whatsapp.py`. Or "clear data/storage" / uninstall and reinstall from Play Store.
